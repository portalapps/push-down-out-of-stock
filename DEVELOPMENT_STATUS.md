# DEVELOPMENT STATUS - Push Down Out of Stock App

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Building a Shopify app that automatically pushes out-of-stock products to the bottom of collection pages while maintaining the merchant's chosen primary sort order (bestsellers, price, etc.).

### Key Features
- Collection-based configuration (merchants select which collections to enable)
- Multiple sort type options (bestsellers, price asc/desc, alphabetical, date)
- Tag-based exclusions (products with tags like "preorder", "coming-soon" stay in their sorted position even when inventory is zero)
- Real-time updates via webhooks
- Native Shopify admin interface using Polaris components

### Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Remix + Vite
- **Database**: Prisma ORM + SQLite
- **UI**: Shopify Polaris components
- **API**: Shopify GraphQL Admin API v2025-07
- **Auth**: Shopify embedded app authentication
- **Language**: TypeScript

## CURRENT STATUS: Phase 3 Complete with Sort Type Fix - Ready for Phase 4 Webhooks Implementation

### âœ… COMPLETED TASKS

#### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Configuration (Tasks 1-4)
- [x] Updated shopify.app.toml with required scopes and permissions
- [x] Configured database schema with 3 tables: Session, CollectionSetting, ExclusionTag
- [x] Set up Prisma client generation and database connection
- [x] Resolved Windows file permission issues with Prisma

#### Phase 2: UI Implementation & Polish - âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Created collections management interface using proper Polaris IndexTable
- [x] Implemented native Shopify admin patterns with resource state management
- [x] Added bulk actions for enabling/disabling collection sorting
- [x] Built clickable status badges without separate buttons
- [x] Implemented search and filtering capabilities
- [x] Added proper event handling to prevent unwanted row selection
- [x] Created comprehensive Polaris UI reference documentation
- [x] Set up server-side data loading with GraphQL integration
- [x] Built reusable TagAutocomplete component with native Shopify UX
- [x] Added navigation structure and additional pages

#### Phase 3: Core Functionality - âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Auto-Save Implementation**: Implemented real-time saving for collection settings and exclusion tags
  - Fixed SQLite compatibility issue with Prisma `skipDuplicates`
  - Added proper error handling for duplicate constraints
  - Resolved React state management issues with useEffect circular dependencies
  - Users can now enable/disable collections, change sort types, and add exclusion tags with automatic persistence
- [x] **Product Fetching & Sorting Engine**: Complete auto-sorting system with seamless UX
  - Auto-trigger sorting on all settings changes (enable/disable, sort type, exclusion tags)
  - Created `collection-sorting.server.ts` service with GraphQL integration
  - Implemented product fetching with inventory tracking and pagination handling
  - Clean UI without processing indicators per user preference
- [x] **Dual-layer sorting algorithm**: Implemented in-stock first, then by selected sort type
  - Products with inventory > 0 and availableForSale stay in top positions
  - Out-of-stock products moved to bottom while maintaining relative order
- [x] **Collection reordering via Admin API**: Full Shopify integration complete
  - Using `collectionReorderProducts` GraphQL mutation
  - Proper error handling and job tracking
  - Products now actually reorder in Shopify collections
- [x] **Tag-based exclusion logic**: Products with exclusion tags maintain position even when out-of-stock
  - Case-insensitive tag matching
  - Per-shop exclusion tag configuration
- [x] **Auto-trigger functionality**: No manual buttons needed, sorts automatically on settings changes
- [x] **Error handling and retry logic**: Complete error handling throughout sorting pipeline
- [x] **Sort Type Implementation Fix (Sep 8, 2025)**: Fixed race condition where auto-sorting used wrong sort type
  - Resolved database/sorting synchronization issue with pending flag approach
  - All sort types now work correctly (Best Selling, A-Z, Z-A, Price High/Low, Date New/Old, Manual)
  - Fixed GraphQL query to use dynamic sort keys instead of hardcoded BEST_SELLING
  - Added proper Shopify ProductCollectionSortKeys mapping with reverse flag support
  - Auto-sorting now waits for database save completion before triggering

#### Phase 4: Real-time Updates
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoints for inventory changes
- [ ] Create webhook verification and security
- [ ] Handle product inventory updates
- [ ] Handle product creation/deletion events
- [ ] Handle collection modifications
- [ ] Add webhook error handling and logging

#### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance testing with large collections
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Production deployment preparation

## KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Database Design
- **CollectionSetting**: Tracks which collections have sorting enabled and their configuration
- **ExclusionTag**: Stores per-shop tags that prevent products from being treated as "out of stock" (they maintain their sorted position even with zero inventory)
- **Unique constraints**: Prevent duplicate settings per shop/collection and shop/tag combinations

### API Approach
- Using GraphQL Admin API for all Shopify interactions
- Collection reordering via `collectionReorderProducts` mutation
- Real-time updates through webhook subscriptions

### UI/UX Decisions
- Native Shopify Polaris IndexTable for collections management
- Clickable status badges instead of separate enable/disable buttons
- Event propagation handling to prevent unwanted row selection
- Bulk actions for managing multiple collections
- Search and filtering capabilities built-in

---

## CURRENT STATE

### Collections Interface Features âœ…
- **IndexTable Implementation**: Native Shopify table with proper resource state management
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable status badges, sort type dropdowns, bulk actions
- **Search & Filter**: Built-in search functionality with tab-based filtering
- **Event Handling**: Proper click isolation to prevent unwanted row selection
- **Visual Design**: Consistent with Shopify admin using proper Polaris patterns

### Technical Implementation âœ…
- **GraphQL Integration**: Fetching collections data from Shopify Admin API
- **State Management**: React hooks for collection settings and UI state
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable TagAutocomplete component
- **Error Handling**: Defensive programming with proper error boundaries

## HOW TO RESUME DEVELOPMENT

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
cd "C:\Users\mathe\OneDrive\Desktop\saascurious\sa_v1\push-down-out-of-stock"
npm run dev  # Start development server
```

### If Database Schema Changes
```bash
npx prisma generate  # Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma migrate dev  # Create and apply migrations
```

### Next Steps
1. **Save Functionality**: Implement database persistence for collection settings
2. **Core Sorting Logic**: Build the dual-layer sorting algorithm
3. **API Integration**: Connect to Shopify's collection reordering mutations
4. **Webhook Setup**: Real-time inventory change handling

**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025 - All sorting functionality complete and working. Fixed critical race condition in sort type implementation. All 8 sort types (Best Selling, A-Z, Z-A, Price High/Low, Date New/Old, Manual) now work correctly with proper GraphQL sorting and automatic out-of-stock push-down functionality.
